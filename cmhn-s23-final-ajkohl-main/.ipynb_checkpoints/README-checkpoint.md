# cmhn-s23-final-project

This is the repo for the final project.

If you are doing the Sherlock Mystery option, please complete the assignment by commiting changes to the question notebook and other notebooks/scripts you write. Please provide your final answers to each question in the `sherlock-final-project.ipynb` notebook. In addition, you must show your work by providing code that generates each answer. This code can be placed in the suggested cells of the question notebook or in separate files you generate for each question, either notebooks or scripts. You are encouraged to commit your changes regularly (good practice in software development), however please make sure that your last commit (submitted automatically at the deadline) contains only those files being used in generating the final solutions. The grading criteria for this option are listed in the Sherlock notebook.

If you are doing the Choose Your Own Adventure or Start From Scratch option, please still use this repo for submission and add your code to the `custom-final-project.ipynb` notebook. You must upload at least one notebook that thoroughly explains your project: any relevant background, the hypotheses you had, references to any resources you used, all of the analyses you conducted (or references to scripts in the repo that were used to run your analyses), and a discussion and interpretation of the results of your analyses. An blank notebook is provided in this repository. For these options, you will be graded on 3 criteria (30 points total):
>Question (6 points): How well thought-out, novel, and insightful is the project idea?  
>Approach (16 points): What methods did you use and were they used appropriately?  
>Clarity (8 points): Is the project execution easy to follow and is the code clear?  

Regardless of the assignment you choose to complete, your code must incorporate all the coding best-practices we have discussed this semester. These include:
* No hard coding variables
* Logical variable naming
* Putting your code into functions, which can be reused throughout the assignment
* Well-commented code, including docstring commenting for functions

Due Date: The final project is due **May 3 by 11:59pm**. Whatever is committed to your assignment repo at that time will be submitted automatically. If you complete the assignment early, please Slack us so we can begin grading. Final grades are due in some cases within 48 hours, so late submissions will not be accepted.

When committing files to github, make sure you do not commit any of the data or results you generate. These can get prohibitively large and make it hard for you to use git. To avoid this, only upload notebooks and scripts.
