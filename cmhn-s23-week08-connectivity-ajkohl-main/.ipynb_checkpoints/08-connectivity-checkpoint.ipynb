    "# Connectivity\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional multivariate fMRI techniques focus on the information present in patterns of activity in localized regions (ROIs or searchlights). Sometimes, the relevant information may be represented across a network of brain regions and thus would not be identified via ROI analysis or searchlights. Functional connectivity measures help examine information at a global level, in regions that are far apart, by focusing on network interaction rather than spatial localization. When performing connectivity analyses, BOLD timeseries are compared across regions (usually with correlation) and the strength of the relationship determines their functional connectivity. By including or excluding stimulus/task variables, we can study the modulation of connectivity by different cognitive states.\n",

    "**Attention and connectivity**\n",
    "\n",
    "Our brain is constantly bombarded by sensory information from the world. Attention refers to the set of cognitive processes that filter this input based on what is salient (e.g., a police siren) and what is relevant (e.g., faces when looking for a friend). Attention biases our behavior and conscious awareness towards these properties of the world and reduces distraction by other properties. At the neural level, attention is controlled by parietal and frontal cortices [(Corbetta and Shulman, 2002)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11994752), which modulate processing in sensory systems, enhancing attended information and suppressing unattended information [(Noudoost et al., 2010)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20303256). Thus, to study the impact of attention on perceptual processing, we need to examine not just a localized brain region but how these regions interact with each other ([Saalman et al., 2007](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17569863); [Gregoriou et al., 2009](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2849291/); [Al-Aidroos et al., 2012](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22908274)). In this case, traditional MVPA techniques that examine patterns of activity in local brain regions will not be sufficient and a more global analysis will be helpful. The covarying response of two or more brain regions becomes critical in this case, and thus functional connectivity measures are important in studying these phenomena."

If we were to examine correlations between the regions, they would have strong connectivity, but not because they are necessarily communicating or interacting in any way. Rather, they share the stimulus as a third variable. One solution is to regress out the stimulus-evoked responses from our signal and re-examine the correlations between regions. If region A and B are still correlated, we are on more solid footing that they are functionally connected during the task. Insofar as this \"background connectivity\" differs between task conditions (e.g., attend left vs. right), we can conclude that the task is modulating the scaffold of noise correlations in the brain. To learn more about background connectivity, see this [review](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.1238409).\n",
    "\n",
    "In background connectivity analysis, stimulus-driven activation is not the desired effect of interest, but potentially a confound. Thus, now we need to remove \"stimulus confounds\" before continuing. Lucky for us, the dataset in the directory `../processed_data/background/`  already has the evoked activity and other nuisance variables regressed out. We'll repeat the previous analyses for the left PPA on these data."
