Score: 4/5  <br>
Comments: Exercise 4: Needs to split labels into train/test splits according to epoch as well as the raw data. <br> Exercise 9: Make sure to threshold your plots - as is, you cannot really see where the different voxels are more or less informative. <br> NC: A bettter approach would be to quantify this by comparing the overlap between the volumes, rather than visualizing such large volumes.  <br>
