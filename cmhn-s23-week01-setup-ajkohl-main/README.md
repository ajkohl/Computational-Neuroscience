Introduction to Computational Methods in Human Neuroscience for Spring 2023. Checks that you can appropriately interact with Github Classrooms, Jupyter notebooks, and BrainIAK.

Please read through the notebook `cmhn-s23-week01-setup.ipynb` and the associated links. Fill out the survey and run the BrainIAK commands at the bottom. If you are new to Python, we also suggest checking out the `python_tutorial.ipynb` notebook included here. This is not necessary to complete but could be a helpful resource in learning Python.

When you are satisfied, commit your changes to this repo. **Note: Do not rename any of the files included in the repo.
